### DevOps + Cloud (AWS) Roadmap for Backend Developers

## DevOps Fundamentals

What is DevOps, goals & benefits

CI/CD concepts: Continuous Integration, Delivery, Deployment

DevOps lifecycle: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

Agile + DevOps connection

--

Branching strategies: Gitflow, Feature Branch

Collaboration tools: GitHub, GitLab

--
## Build & Dependency Management

Maven / Gradle: build lifecycle, dependency management, packaging JAR/WAR

Artifact repository overview: Nexus, Artifactory

--
## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

CI/CD pipeline overview

Industry CI/CD tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

Automated builds & testing, static code analysis

--
## Containers & Orchestration

Docker: containerization, images, containers
